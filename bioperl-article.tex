\begin{abstract}

The Bioperl project, an international open source collaboration of
biologists, bioinformaticists, and computer scientists that has
evolved over the last 7 years into the most comprehensive library of
Perl modules for manipulating and managing life science information.
Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent
programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers.
Bioperl has been successfully and repeatedly used to achieve otherwise
complex tasks with only a few lines of code.  The Bioperl object model
has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level
applications such as EnsEMBL, while at the same time keeping an easy
learning curve for novice Perl programmers.  Bioperl is also capable
of interoperating with other programming languages like Python and
Java through the evolving BioCORBA bridge and the accessing common
data storage through the BioSQL and Open Bioinformatics Database
Access projects.  The successful development of Bioperl
depended in a large part on the open source nature of the project.  We
outline how this approach is a valuable mechanism for collaborative
projects.

\section{Introduction}

Computational analysis is an integral part of modern biological
research.  Numerous computer software tools exist to perform 
data analyses, however it is not simple to automatically
combine data and results from multiple sources without the use of
computer software designed to read and write the specific data
formats.  Bioinformatics consists largely of applying a
particular logic to this data integration.  Custom software is
often needed to execute tasks particular to specific data formats.

One programming language, Perl, is by far the most widely used
programming language for these tasks, and is commonly thought of as
the language most easily grasped by newcomers to the field.  Perl has
been extremely successful for connecting software applications together into
sequence analysis pipelines, converting file formats, and extracting
information from the output of analysis programs and other text files.

Much of the Perl software in bioinformatics is specific to a
particular lab or institution and is not written in a general way so
that it can be used by others.  A primary motivation behind writing
this toolkit was the authors' desire to focus our energies on one
solution whose components could be shared rather duplicating effort.
In our minds, once a solution for parsing and interpreting sequence
from EMBL and Genbank format sequence files is written, no one else
should have to worry about writing their own.  In this spirit we chose
to make our code freely available and open source so that others could
contribute their solutions to the project as well.  We have found that
like the human genome project, openess has reduced the time needed for
solutions and new tools to reach the community \cite{waterston}.

However, to be adopted by the community our software has be user
friendly.  To that end we've both provided extensive documentation of
all the methods in each module, a graphical diagram of the objects in
the toolkit, and a number of tutorials with examples of common
problems.  Additionally we have written a module named Bio::Perl which
provides simple methods such as  \textit{read\_sequence} which
reads a sequence from a file for users who do not want to
understand the entire module hierarchy.

\section{Methods}

The Bioperl project began in 1995 \cite{chervitz-bits} when there were
few programming toolkits for manipulating biological data and results
from sequence analysis programs.  Although Perl had already gained
widespread popularity in the bioinformatics community for its
efficient support of text processing and pattern matching tasks, there
were in fact no biological toolkits available in this language.

The project grew out of the following observations.  
\begin{itemize}

\item First, Even though file formats of different analysis programs
are different, the information they represent is the same.  For
example, a pair-wise alignment is always between two sequences and has
common properties such as length, score, fraction of identities, start
and end of the aligned sequences, and so forth.

\item Second, the number of data structures needed to represent
information flow is limited, and common to most applications, such as
sequences, annotation, features, and alignments.  This permits a small
set of modules to be reused for variety of purposes and avoids
creating a confusing hierarchy of components.

\item Third, a set of operations is performed on these data structures
that are useful for a variety of tasks.  This include reading and
writing information to a file, querying a sequence for its features,
and translating a gene coding sequence into protein.  

\end{itemize}

This scenario naturally lends itself to the principle of
object-oriented programming, which Perl emulates with modules.
Object-oriented programming is the practice of grouping related tasks
together into logical components such as a DNA Sequence component
which could contain methods such as retrieve the accession number,
reverse complement, or translated protein sequence.  Hence, the
mission of Bioperl is to provide an easy-to-use object-oriented Perl
library that encapsulates data structures and operations commonly used
in the life sciences as clean, generic, and re-usable modules.  We
achieve this by separating the components into logical groups, such as
sequences, alignments, and databases.  This separation allows us to
add features to a specific module without necessarily affecting the
rest of the toolkit library.  This separation is a key component to
object-oriented programming and permits us to produce generic
components which can be used in situations they were not necessarily
first written for. 

The goal of Bioperl is to help a user focus on their specific problem
at hand, such as the logic needed to process a BLAST \cite{blast}
report searching for hits that meet a certain species and sequence
length requirement, rather than the actual mechanics of
\textit{parsing} that BLAST report.

Bioperl is written purely in Perl and depends on at least version 5.005
of the Perl interpreter.  The toolkit has been checked
for cross-platform compatibility on most UNIX and UNIX-like operating
systems in addition to Macintosh OS X and Microsoft Windows operating
systems.  Since the toolkit is run through the Perl interpreter,
specific issues are often due to compatibility between different
versions of Perl.  Descriptions of specific bugs and their solutions
are available from the Bioperl website.

In addition to pure Perl solutions to bioinformatics problems, Bioperl
can take advantage of external data analysis packages.  Currently the
toolkit supports interactions with applications in the EMBOSS
\cite{emboss} suite, NCBI BLAST, and the multiple sequence alignment
programs ClustalW \cite{clustalw} and T-Coffee \cite{tcoffee}.  In
some cases, when an external package is not available, Bioperl will
fall back to using a slower method, either emulating the package in
pure Perl or by invoking a network based analysis service such as the
NCBI BLAST analysis queue.  Additional work is in progress to
incorporate into the project access to remote analysis services at the
European Bioinformatics Institute and Pasteur Institute [ELABORATE HERE?].

\section{Object and Data Model}

At present the objects and operations in Bioperl center around
biological sequence analysis and annotation.  In the last year the
project has expanded to address new areas including phylogenetics,
maps, protein structure, and bibliographic references.  The project
has over 300 modules and comprises more than 160,000 lines of code and
embedded documentation.  The Perl modules are organized by logical
names so that, for example, the Bio::Search hierarchy contains modules
related to database searches and Bio::Graphics contains modules that
are related to drawing.

\subsection{Design principles}

When designing the library's object hierarchy, our objective was to
provide a programming interface that is very easy to use but that at
the same time could be easily extended in its capabilities and behaviour
through code reuse.  Using the object-oriented paradigm to design
our modules we followed certain design principles.  

\begin{itemize}

\item Separating the interface from the implementation.  The key
information about an object class is the list of arguments to pass to
the object's methods.  By putting this information into its own
module, called an interface, the actual implementation can be provided
by multiple independent libraries without risk of clashes.  This is
preferable to requiring that each implementation inherit from a common
base class, which has scaleability problems as object classes become
increasingly complex.

\item Generalize common routines into a module.  When many modules
follow the same route to accessing data it is useful to group those
routines together.  A good example of this is data Input/Output (IO).
A toplevel IO object called Bio::Root::IO was created to manage basic
access to files and data streams.  All modules that need data access
inherit from the IO module and use the same read and write functions.
This approach lends itself to consistency across the entire package;
all implementations using the IO module will do so consistently making
it easy for developers to evaluate each other's code.  It is also ease
share any enhancements to the common methods because any changes made
in the parent module will be inherited by the child modules.

\end{itemize}

In Bioperl we followed these two design patterns \cite{gangoffour}
throughout the library wherever possible.  Most classes come as an
interface, with a capital 'I' appended to the object name (e.g.,
Bio::SeqI and Bio::Seq), together with a ready-to-use fully functional
implementation.

In order for us to produce fairly uniform software code we established
some coding guidelines that are extensions of good object-oriented
programming.  All modules were required to meet minimal standards
before releasing.  These standards included a complete set of
regression tests, well formed embedded documentation for each method,
and a concise example code in the SYNOPSIS section of each module's
documention.  The Perl embedded documentation format called POD, or
Plain Old Documentation, is used to provide annotation within the
source code.  This documentation can be converted to text, TeX, or
HTML.  We have used the Pdoc\cite{pdoc} tool to generate colored and
organized documention in HTML for easy online browsing.

Part of the development process is to insure that all parts of the
code are tested.  This is accomplished by insuring that each module
has a test in the Bioperl test system.  This approach is effective in
locating newly introduced bugs and is a tenent of the Extreme
Programming\cite{xprogramming} methodology which we use in some
aspects of our development process.  The Extreme Programming approach
to tests is to build the test first and then build one's object to
insure that all aspects of implementation were correctly completed.
We attempt to follow many of the Extreme Programming approaches for
developing software which emphasizes quick production of working code. 
The Bioperl 1.0 release has over 3000 tests which help us insure the
quality of the release and check that new changes to the code base do
not break existing functionality.

To support multiple developers in different time zones and
institutions, a centralized repository for the source code for the
project was setup in Boston, MA.  The Open Bioinformatics Foundation
(OBF) was founded, in part, to provide server space for source code
repositories and websites to various open source bioinformatics
toolkits.  Using a software development tool called Concurrent Version
Control system \cite{cvs,cvsbook} multiple developers can work on the
software source code at the same time and commit their changes into a
central repository without having to communicate.  The ability to share
code easily and quickly is one of the primary building blocks in
establishing a successful open source project.

\subsection{Example usage}

The following examples provide typical usage for some of the Bioperl
objects in simple scripts.  The first example, shown in Figure
\ref{example1}, will retrieve an mRNA sequences from the EBI EMBL
databank with the accession number U14680 and write the sequence out
in GenBank format to the screen.  One could replace Bio::DB::EMBL with
Bio::DB::GenBank and instead retrieve the sequence from NCBI.

In the second example, shown in Figure \ref{example2}, a BLAST report
is parsed and only certain hits meeting an e-value and length
threshold are saved.  In this case any hit with evalue greater than
0.001 or length less than 120 residues will be excluded.  Once the
list of hits is built one can print out the name of each of the Hits
which had High Scoring Pairs (HSPs) that met the criteria.

\section{Results}

Bioperl has 10 active developers led by a core of 5 primary developers
who insure that standards are met, prepare code releases, and set the
vision for the project.  The mailing lists for the project include
1300 subscribers and about 10,000 unique visitors to our website each
month.  The project has been used in variety of endeavors including
genome sequencing, annotation, sequence variation elucidation, disease
gene discovery, and comparative genomics.

By far the most advanced use of the Bioperl toolkit has come through
the EnsEMBL\cite{ensembl-nar} project.  The basic sequence handling,
file format parsing, and sequence features for annotation model have
been used as building blocks for automatically annotating the
\textit{Danio rerio}, \textit{Drosophila melanogastor}, \textit{Fugu
ripes}, \textit{Homo sapiens}, and \textit{Mus musculus} genomes.

Additionally the Genquire\cite{genquire} annotation package makes use
of the Bioperl object model and stores sequence and annotation data in
a persistent database model.  The sequence rendering capabilities are
partitioned into a specific Bioperl package called bioperl-gui.  The
database model used by Genquire has been updated to utilize the
Open Bioinformatics Database Access (OBDA) (\url{http://obda.open-bio.org}) sequence database design, which
will allow the other OBF toolkits to access data written by the
Genquire system.

The Generic Model Organism Browser (GMOD) \cite{gmod}, Distributed
Annotation System Perl (DAS) server \cite{das}, and TFBS
\cite{tfbs} all use the Bioperl object model to describe sequences and
Bioperl tools to complete analyses.  The GMOD system is a web
interface to databases of features for a genome project.  The DAS
system provides researchers a means to locally annotate sequences and
publish the annotations to the community via the DAS XML protocol.
TFBS provides a perl implementation of objects for DNA sequence pattern
representation by matrix profiles, with associated methods for searching
the sequences for the occurence of patterns, pattern storage, and
generation of new patterns. The implementation uses bioperl sequence,
alignment, sequence feature and feature pair objects.

\subsection{Interoperability}

Sometimes the best solution for a bioinformatics problem is a hybrid
of multiple tools.  These tools, written in different programming
languages such as C, Java, and Python, can be used within a Perl
script simply by invoking them (a process often called "shelling
out").  In some situations these tools require that data be available
in a certain format or within a certain database.  Bioperl provides
software layers which can, for example, populate a database with
sequence information which can be accessed and used to generate an
interactive graphical interface provided by the BioJava toolkit.
In other cases, Bioperl is used to create files in a format recognized
by other programs so that they can perform their analyses. 

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a means for creating
data in a language and platform independent manner.  Previous work has
outlined scenarios where XML has been useful in a biological context
\cite{xml_bioinformatics}.  Bioperl supports several XML standards for
biological data including BSML and (read only) GAME (read/write)
sequence markup formats.  Bioperl can parse NCBI BLAST XML format in
addition to the standard BLAST text format.  It also supports Medline
XML (read only) provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute's
Bibliographic Query Service (BQS) and Entrez Pubmed XML format.

The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
allows a programmer to share components developed in different
languages.  This is achieved by first agreeing upon the names of
functions and data the components will contain.  Developers write the
software for the components in their favorite language and run a
program called a server where the components can be accessed from.  A
simple example of this is a component to retrieve sequences from a
database.  It is written in the Perl and is loaded into a server
program.  A programmer will then write software in Java which connects
to the server program and requests a specific sequence by its
accession number.  The Perl component will do its job and find the
sequence and return it to the Java program.  Using these types of
building blocks larger and more complex bioinformatics solutions can
be built which can maximize the strengths of various programming
languages and environments.  An example of a proposed standard for
CORBA components for biological processes is the BioCORBA
(\url{http://www.biocorba.org}) project.  It is a collaborative
project which has involved members of the Bioperl, BioJava
(\url{http://www.biojava.org}), and Biopython
(\url{http://www.biopython.org}) projects as well as the Object
Management Group's Life Science Research group
(\url{http://lsr.ebi.ac.uk}).

This interoperability has also been applied to the EnsEMBL project.
The EnsEMBL (v. 4) software layer is a collection of perl modules
built on top of the Bioperl library.  Using an EnsEMBL-CORBA interface
derived from BioCORBA, a perl EnsEMBL CORBA server has been written
which is accessible to C, Java, and Python clients, and therefore
making the EnsEMBL data and algorithms programatically available to
these languages.

\subsection{Future Plans}

Bioperl will continue to evolve in order to address more issues in
bioinformatics.  We have plans to create objects to manage sequence
assembly information, haplotype maps, gene expression, and protein
interaction data.  Additionally, projects focusing on multi-species
comparisions are building Perl modules to manage the alignment and
syntenic information.  We are creating software layers to interact
with OBDA databases, developing an analysis pipeline system to provide
automated annotation, and expanding the supported file formats the
toolkit can read and write.

\section{Conclusions}

Much of the success of the Bioperl toolkit development effort can be
attributed to the Open Source nature of the development effort which
has allowed a diverse group of individuals to participate in
collaborative project.  By encouraging users of the toolkit to also
assist in the development of it, contributions are made back to the
source code base which can benefit all users.  This collaborative
effort and the strong need to get working software written in
an extensible manner has made Bioperl an excellent platform for Perl
bioinformatics software development.  This open sharing of ideas that
embodies the scientific spirit is successful in the world of software
development for scientific purposes as well and has permitted the
toolkit to grow in directions pertinent to its users.
